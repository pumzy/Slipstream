# Slipstream

## Background

This will be an infinite runner type game based on vector runner remix, an online HTML5 game. Slipstream is a one player game, that will utilise a "game window" (most likely an HTML5 canvas element) for most of the game functionality, where the player will control a "vehicle". The rules of the game are as follows:

1) The game window will consist of multiple platforms, which will be at random points on the X and Y axis of the game window.
2) The user earns points both by continuing driving, and by collecting "power cubes"
3) The user has 5 lives. Lives are lost by bumping into obstacles, or by falling off the map
4) Obstacles are positioned on the platforms, and users must jump over these obstacles to avoid them.
